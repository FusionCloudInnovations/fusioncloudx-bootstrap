# VMs and optional devices are managed by Infrastructure repository

# REMOVED DEVICES (moved to Infrastructure repository):
# - HP OfficeJet Pro 9015e (network printer) → ansible/playbooks/optional/deploy-device-certificates.yml
# - UniFi Dream Machine Pro → ansible/inventory/devices.yaml
# - UNAS Pro → ansible/inventory/devices.yaml
# - Raspberry Pi → ansible/inventory/devices.yaml
#
# Bootstrap only handles devices required for "Terraform-ready" state.
# All other devices are managed by FusionCloudX Infrastructure repository.
